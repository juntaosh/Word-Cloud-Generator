To run the White Box Testing case, we provide you a shell script that you can simply 
  call ./run.sh //keep in mind that some of the instructions need to be modified to be able to run
  to run white box
And it will automatically call the testing files. 
You can see the output on screen as well.

To run the Black Box Testing case, 
  You have to cd ~/Word-Cloud-Generator/Project
  and run bin/behat features/search.feature
          bin/behat features/share.feature
